<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I’m a bit of a compulsive book collector. It started slowly, but through the years I’ve accrued a few volumes. Generally, I like to associate each book with the circumstances under which I received/acquired it - these were for a paper about Frantz Fanon, these were after visiting Europe and becoming really interested in modern architecture, etc.</p>
<p>Previously, this was also my method for organization. Books were grouped together by origin story. Sometimes this led to thematic groupings, but other times there appeared no apparent connection.</p>
<p>Alas, after a few changes in apartment this system broke down, until I was left with an <em>almost</em> random ordering. Devising a system for reorganization on my own seemed an impossible task (or you know, really hard). However, there are other systems for such organization - namely, the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and the Library of Congress Classification (LCC).</p>
</div>
<div id="purpose" class="section level2">
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>This post is the result of my efforts to obtain DDC and LCC information for the associated ISBN values using the <a href="http://classify.oclc.org/classify2/api_docs/index.html">OCLC Classify API</a>. It is also my first significant endeavor in using R - I am very much looking for any code review or feedback.</p>
<p>So far I’ve achieved the first goal I set out, but along the way I’ve stumbled upon so many other cool things to do. Certainly there might be some potential for an API wrapper if that’s something R could use.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(xml2)

<pre class="r"><code>book_csv &lt;- &quot;library_20190223200451.csv&quot;
book_list &lt;- read_csv(book_csv)
isbn_list &lt;- book_list$isbn13
options(scipen = 99)</code></pre>
<p>I used <a href="https://www.libib.com">Libib</a> to scan the ISBN barcodes from the books when available or input manually when not. It populated quite a bit of info itself.</p>

<div id="process" class="section level2">
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>My general approach was to break the process of retrieving one book’s classification into steps and then <code>map()</code> that over the whole list of books.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Get the XML object from OCLC</li>
<li>Parse that object and extract DDC, LCC, and OWI</li>
<li>Attach classification info back to respective book</li>
</ol>
<div id="get-the-xml-object-from-oclc" class="section level3">
<h3>Get the XML object from OCLC</h3>
<p>This function takes a value and a classification system (currently only “isbn13” and “owi”), queries the OCLC API, and returns a list (from xml) object for that value.</p>
<p>Future: generalize <code>type</code>, add support for other API fields, toggle for summary</p>
<pre class="r"><code>oclc_get_raw &lt;- function(number, type=&quot;isbn13&quot;) {
  
    base_OCLC &lt;- &quot;http://classify.oclc.org/classify2/Classify?&quot;
    end_base_OCLC &lt;- &quot;&amp;summary=true&quot;

  if(tolower(type) == &quot;isbn13&quot;) {
    lookup_type &lt;- &quot;isbn&quot;
  } else if(tolower(type) == &quot;owi&quot;) {
    lookup_type &lt;- &quot;owi&quot;
  } else {
    message(&quot;Classification type not recognized.&quot;)
    break
  }
  call_address &lt;- paste0(base_OCLC, lookup_type, &quot;=&quot;, number, end_base_OCLC)
  oclc_xml_list &lt;- read_xml(call_address) %&gt;% as_list()
  
}</code></pre>
<p>This next function is a little out of order, but I think I have to define it before it gets called in the following function. It simply retrieves a value (“ddc”, “lcc”, or “owi”) from one of the xml_list objects and returns NA if not found. Some entries were missing DDC or LCC classifications. If they were missing OWI values, all three values would be missing.</p>
<p>My lesson: R won’t return NA if you point to nonexistent values; it will return NULL, which isn’t a vector or list, thus causing further issues.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>retrieve_val &lt;- function(value, xml_list) {
  x1 &lt;- attributes(xml_list[[&quot;classify&quot;]][[&quot;recommendations&quot;]][[value]][[&quot;mostPopular&quot;]])[[&quot;nsfa&quot;]]
    ifelse(!is.null(x1), x1, NA)
}

#Hopefully this fixes the 1d thing, might&#39;ve been missing some OWI
retrieve_owi &lt;- function(value, xml_list) {
  x1 &lt;- attributes(xml_list[[&quot;classify&quot;]][[&quot;work&quot;]])[[value]]
    ifelse(!is.null(x1), x1, NA)
}</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="parse-that-object-and-extract-ddc-lcc-and-owi" class="section level3">
<h3>Parse that object and extract DDC, LCC, and OWI</h3>
<p>Each xml object had 1 of 3 codes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&quot;0&quot;</code> indicates a successful query</li>
<li><code>&quot;4&quot;</code> indicates multiple entries for that ISBN value (not possible for OWI)</li>
<li><code>&quot;102&quot;</code> indicates no entry found</li>
</ul>
<p>Below I mistakenly treat 102 as an error and re-query.</p>
<p>For each <code>&quot;4&quot;</code>, I retrieved the OWI of the first listing and used it to submit another query. Each OWI could only have a single result.</p>
<p>After receiving an xml-list object with code <code>&quot;0&quot;</code>, I extracted the classifications using the above functions and put them together in a data frame, replacing NULL values with NA.</p>
<p>One of the messiest things about this code is all the repeated brackets and <code>attributes()</code>. I suspect there’s a way to clean that up with <code>%&gt;%</code> and <code>~.</code> but I’ll have to investigate further.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>recs_xml_list &lt;- function(oclc_xml_list) {
  #Checking response code. &quot;4&quot; indicates multiple entries found for isbn, &quot;102&quot; indicates technical malfunction, &quot;0&quot; indicates successful retrieval
  code &lt;- attributes(oclc_xml_list[[&quot;classify&quot;]][[&quot;response&quot;]])[[&quot;code&quot;]]  
  
  
 if(code == 4 | code == 102) {
   #Find OWI of first work and get xml object with it instead (or just trying again in case of 102)
    owi2 &lt;- attributes(oclc_xml_list[[&quot;classify&quot;]][[&quot;works&quot;]][[1]])[[&quot;owi&quot;]]
    oclc_xml_list &lt;- oclc_get_raw(owi2, type = &quot;owi&quot;)
  } else  if(code==0) {
    oclc_xml_list &lt;- oclc_xml_list
  } else {
    #included for safety?
    message(&quot;Unrecognized error code.&quot;)
    break
  }
    #If successful retrieval, some books won&#39;t have lcc or dcc. These receive NA for the respective value.  
      ddc &lt;- retrieve_val(&quot;ddc&quot;, oclc_xml_list)
      lcc &lt;- retrieve_val(&quot;lcc&quot;, oclc_xml_list)
      owi &lt;- retrieve_owi(&quot;owi&quot;, oclc_xml_list)
  #I was getting an error here about owi being a 1d vector or list so I am messing around with it
  #Edit: turns out it was because some ISBN values aren&#39;t recorded, so OWI was returning NULL, which isn&#39;t 1d vector or list
  recs_df &lt;- data_frame(ddc = ddc, lcc = lcc, owi = owi)
  recs_df
}</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="attach-classification-info-back-to-respective-book" class="section level3">
<h3>Attach classification info back to respective book</h3>
<p>This code runs over the whole <code>isbn13</code> column in <code>book_list</code>. The first command is what takes the longest. I’m not sure what the limiting factor is there, but speeding it up would definitely be nice.</p>
<p>I also don’t love that I’ve made it stick together a whole list of xml objects then parse them. I suspect it would be faster to do one query, parse, return values, then move on to next query.</p>
<p>Future: I want to make a way to attach values back to original list by matching the ISBN. Right now it just collects them all into a long data frame and glues them back to the side.</p>

<h2>Mistakes and Lessons</h2>
<p>This final approach is the product of many dead ends. My initial googling turned up <a href="https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books">Open Library Books API</a>, which looked very promising. It could send JSON objects, and it had tons of information about each title. Unfortunately, it was missing quite a few entries (~60).</p>
<p>I then found the OCLC API, but after struggling with the less-than-cooperative XML formats I resumed searching to find the <a href="https://isbndb.com/apidocs">ISBNdb API</a>. Although it requires a paid plan, I conceded that a paid service ($10) would probably be more complete and responsive. The cost would certainly be worth a few hours of hacking.</p>
<p>In the end, it also wasn’t as complete as I would hope. However, I did learn how to submit <code>GET</code> requests using <code>add_headers()</code>. My lesson: if you want <code>X-API-KEY: MY-KEY</code>, the function will add “:” itself - <code>add_headers(&quot;X-API-KEY&quot; = my_key)</code>.</p>
